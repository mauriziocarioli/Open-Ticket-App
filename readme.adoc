= Open Ticket If Device Does Not Come Back Up

A simple complex event processing use case for a telecommunication company
implemented with Red Hat Decision Manager.

When power is not automatically restored after an outage
a technician must be dispatched to the location.

Execution scripts for several scenarios are in the scripts directory.

== Scenario 1: Feed csv file (local execution)

* Execute script AlertDataLoaderDriver.sh
* Search for "Major alert" in the output.

== Scenario 2: Real time execution (server execution)

* Deploy project Open-Ticket https://github.com/mauriziocarioli/Open-Ticket
* Execute script server-test.py (alternatively, server-test.sh)
